# TPC-BiGAT

This repository contains code related to my paper *Rumor Detection on Potential Hot Topics with Bi-Directional Graph Attention Network*.

## Outline

In this paper:

- We cluster single tweet into topics for topic-level rumor detection. 
- We introduce the neural topic model into rumor detection task for the first time to automatically cluster textual information. 
- We design a topic heat model to filter irrelevant information and reduce the impact of them. 
- We model the rumor propagation process as a graph structure and use a bi-directional graph attention network to learn it. 
- Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed method achieves a better detection performance compared to existing baselines.

## How to use

### Environment Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following environment installed:

- Python 3.7 and above
- Required dependency libraries (can be found in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation of dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running code

Depending on the model, dataset, and training parameters used, relevant configurations are made in the `config.py` file, and then the main program entry file is executed to start it.

```
python main.py
```
